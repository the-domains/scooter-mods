            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Giant Galaxy Orbiting Our Own Just Appeared Out of Nowhere</h1><p>Researchers scanning the skies just got a big surprise. They spotted a humongous galaxy orbiting our own, where none had been seen before. It appeared, seemingly, out of nowhere.

In other words, it's the first remote to understand where it is in your home and what it's pointing at, allowing users to simply point and click to control devices instead of switching between apps.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df1caa77bd36920224edf22d445e863c5b829e80.jpg"></article>]]></description>
